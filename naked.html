<h1>Naked bike</h1>
<img src="motopics/naked.jpg" title="Yamaha FZ6 S2">

<p>Standards, also called naked bikes or roadsters, are versatile, general-purpose street motorcycles. They are recognized primarily by their upright riding position, partway between the reclining rider posture of the cruisers and the forward leaning sport bikes. Footpegs are below the rider and handlebars are high enough to not force the rider to reach far forward, placing the shoulders above the hips in a natural position. Because of their flexibility, lower costs and their engines of moderate output, standards are particularly suited to motorcycle beginners.</p>
